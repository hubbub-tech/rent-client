                        Hubbub's operations will be entering a pause. As part of that process, 
                        we are winding down the website which will prevent you from logging into your account,
                        reserving new rentals, or managing existing reservations. If you are already a user,
                        we have sent you details on operations this spring. We have also included the text to
                        that email below. You can always reach us at <strong className="text-dark">hello@hubbub.shop</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-center">...</p>
                    <p className="text-start mt-3">
                        First off, we the co-founders and operators of Hubbub – Ade, Caro, and Patrick – would like 
                        to thank every one of you for your continued support and acceptance of this new way of getting 
                        what you need for only as long as you need it. We wouldn’t have made it this far without your 
                        belief in us.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-start">
                        Looking ahead to the upcoming months, we know that most of you have item rentals that end in 
                        April/May or beyond. We wanted to reach out with some anticipation to let you all know that 
                        things are going to be a bit different this year. Most importantly, we won’t be reaching out 
                        to coordinate individual pick-ups like we normally do. Instead, we are providing you with the 
                        following options:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>You can keep your item(s).</strong> This means you can take them with you to your summer 
                            housing or back home or store them. With this option, Hubbub would just keep the initial deposit
                            on your item(s), and then they’re all yours.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>You can donate your item(s).</strong> With the majority of our users being either NYU or Columbia students, 
                            we’ve made it easy for you to do this by providing details on how to do this on either campus. For Columbia, fill out this 
                            <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQT4TKVSpAfvyZ2l8tUqXX5JHd_t4B7DZg4xtf6iMhrbOUhA/viewform'>form</a> 
                            or look out for more information on the donation program Give and Go Green <a href='https://www.instagram.com/columbia.ecoreps/?hl=en'>here</a>. 
                            For NYU, click <a href='https://wp.nyu.edu/sustainability-nyusustainablog/2021/05/03/reduce-waste-and-donate-resources-for-a-sustainable-move-out/'>here</a> 
                            for tips and look out for more potential updates <a href='https://www.instagram.com/nyu_green/'>here</a>. With this option, Hubbub 
                            would keep the initial deposit on your item(s).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>You can sell your item(s).</strong> There are many ways and platforms for selling that you can post your 
                            item(s) on to make some $$$. Some key resources we'd recommend would include (1) Facebook Marketplace, (2) OfferUp (app), 
                            (3) Columbia/NYU buy/sell Facebook pages. With this option, Hubbub would keep the initial deposit on your item(s).
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        If none of these options sound like they’d work for your circumstances, you can reach out to us at hello@hubbub.shop 
                        to see if there’s anything else we can figure out together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Things are different this time around as we’ve decided to put Hubbub’s current operations on pause. 
                        We would've loved to continue serving you and promoting this mission of sustainability for much longer, 
                        but changes in our personal circumstances along with difficulty in acquiring continued funding for Hubbub 
                        have led us to this conclusion. Our team is figuring out what the next evolution of Hubbub might look like 
                        but in the meantime, we appreciate your patience.
